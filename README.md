# About
This is a website called "Odin Recipes" and there are links on it that would lead to three(3) foods that I think are my favorite foods to eat.

This is a project I was tasked to do from The Odin Project and is purely html. Due to it, I have gained wisdom from the hands-on experience of making a website.

# From Hands-On Experience
- Learned how to make a website.
- Learned how to make webpages and style them.
- Learned how to use git commit and commit amend.
- Learned to be careful with my commits because I made an error on 3rd and 4th commit adding an anchor tag on index.html linking to a not yet finished and not yet added webpage.
- Learned to save my files first before committing based on my 3rd and 4th commit of "./recipes/chicken-curry.html".
- Learned basic indentation and refactoring of code.
